# ML-Anomaly_Detection

I have performed Anomaly Detection Analysis.

In this I've used Pythonâ€™s Famous libraries like [Numpy](), [Matplotlib](), [Scipy](), and [Sklearn]() for Analysis and Detection of Anomalies.

I've used [Jupyter Notebook]() for coding!

# Anomaly Detection

Anomaly detection is the process of identifying unexpected items or events in data sets, which differ from the norm. And anomaly detection is often applied on unlabeled data which is known as unsupervised anomaly detection.

Anomaly detection has two basic assumptions:

* Anomalies only occur very rarely in the data.
* Their features differ from the normal instances significantly.
